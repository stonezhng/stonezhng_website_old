# Who am I

I am Sidong Zhang, a Ph.D student in the [Information Fusion Lab](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/infofusion/home) of Computer Science Department at UMass Amherst, advised by [Prof. Madalina Fiterau](https://www.cics.umass.edu/people/fiterau-brostean-madalina).

My primary research interests are **Computer Vision**, **Deep Learning in Healthcare** and **Interpretability in Machine Learning**. 

I am also interested in Optimization and Advanced Algebra.

# Projects

### **Project 4Thought**

[Project 4Thought](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/infofusion/4thought-early-forecasting-of-alzheimers-disease/) aims to preemptively forecast Alzheimer’s disease. We are looking to identify subjects who will get Alzheimer’s at least 2 years ahead of the standard diagnosis, based on brain structural MRIs, cognitive test scores and other biomarkers avaiable at [ADNI](http://adni.loni.usc.edu/). We introduce forecasting models that leverage multimodal data and domain knowledge.

4Thought was homegrown here at CICS in the [Information Fusion Lab](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/infofusion/home), supported by the Manning/IALS Innovation Award. 4Thought was initially led by Joie Wu, and is now led by Sidong Zhang (me). Our mentors from IALS are Peter Reinhart and Karen Utgoff.
